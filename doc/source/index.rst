Features
--------
PyCGTOOL provides a means to quickly and easily generate coarse-grained molecular dynamics models within the MARTINI framework from all-atom or united-atom simulation trajectories.

A user defined mapping is applied to the input trajectory and bonded terms (lengths, angles and dihedrals) are measured.  From these measurements, equilibrium values and force constants are found and a GROMACS topology is created for the target molecules.

Requirements
------------
PyCGTOOL requires:

- Python 3
- Numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
- simpletraj (https://github.com/arose/simpletraj)

Optional:

- MDTraj for pseudo-CG XTC output (http://mdtraj.org/1.7.2/) with own dependencies:

  - Scipy (https://www.scipy.org/)
  - Cython (http://cython.org/)

- Python testing framework (e.g. Nose2, py.test)
- Numba for increased performance (http://numba.pydata.org/)
- Sphinx to generate documentation yourself (http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/)

Basic Usage
-----------
PyCGTOOL requires four input files to generate a coarse-grained model:

-g       GROMACS gro coordinate file
-x       GROMACS xtc trajectory file
-m       PyCGTOOL mapping definition file
-b       PyCGTOOL bond definition file

The program is called by::

    pycgtool.py -g <GRO file> -x <XTC file> -m <MAP file> -b <BND file>

Example mapping and bond definition files are present in the ``test/data`` directory.  Their format is explained below.

After running PyCGTOOL two files, ``out.gro`` and ``out.itp`` will be created.  The gro file contains the mapped coarse-grain coordinates with every molecule for which a mapping was provided.  The itp file contains the parameters for each molecule type.  **NB**: charges are not currently set by PyCGTOOL as MARTINI only allows charges on certain bead types.

Mapping / Bond Definition Files
-------------------------------
The mapping and bond definition input files use a format similar to the GROMACS itp/top format.

Mapping Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An example of mapping definition file for the monosaccharide allose taken from ``test/data/sugar.map`` is shown below.

Molecule names (as present in the gro coordinate file) are used as section headers inside square brackets.  Each of the following lines describes a single coarse-grained bead mapping.  The items on a line are: the name of the bead, its MARTINI bead type, a list of all the atom names it should contain.  All items on a line are whitespace separated.  Multiple molecules may be specified in their own sections.  It is not recommended to provide a mapping for water since MARTINI water combines four molecules into a single bead which is not yet supported by PyCGTOOL. ::

Bond Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An example bond definition file for the monosaccharide allose taken from ``test/data/sugar.bnd`` is shown below.

As in the mapping definition file, molecule names are used as section headers inside square brackets.  The following lines define bonds lengths, angles and dihedrals between coarse-grained beads.  Each line is a list of bead names, using the names defined in the mapping file.  Two bead names on a line defines a bond length, three defines an angle, and four defines a dihedral.

If no angles are defined for a molecule, PyCGTOOL will construct all angles from the list of bonds.  This may also be enabled for dihedrals via the ``--interactive`` flag, but is not recommended as in most cases coarse-grained models do not require dihedrals.  Additionally, any angles inside a triangle of bond lengths are excluded from the output as they often cause simulation stability issues when used in conjunction with LINCS. ::

Advanced Usage

Modes
~~~~~
PyCGTOOL performs several other functions which may be useful in the testing and use of coarse-grained models.

Mapping-only mode performs a coarse-grain mapping on a single frame and may be used to generate initial coordinates for a coarse-grain simulation, whether the model being used was created by PyCGTOOL or not.  In this respect it functions similarly to the MARTINI tool MARTINIZE.  This mode may be invoked by::

   pycgtool.py -g <GRO file> -m <MAP file>

Measure-only mode may be used to aid in the testing of a coarse-grained model by making measurements of bonds from a true corase-grained simulation trajectory.  These bond measurements are those collected from the pseudo-coarse-grained trajectory used to generate the model, so are a directly comparable measure of model accuracy.  This mode may be invoked by::

   pycgtool.py -g <GRO file> -x <XTC file> -b <BND file>

Options
~~~~~~~
By passing the flag ``--interactive`` to PyCGTOOL several advanced options are accessible.  The arrow keys may be used to navigate through the menu.  Enter selects an option to be edited, or if the option is boolean toggles it.  Once you have edited an option press enter again.  When all options are satisfactory, press q to proceed.
